# Sign-Language-App
Goals: App that can recognize any letter in ASL (American Sign Language). Will try to incorporate all other sign languages after that. Want to add ability to write to other apps using the webcam and sign language. Create a sign-to-speech feature?

Install Dependencies: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
